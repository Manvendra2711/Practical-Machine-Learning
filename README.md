# Practical-Machine-Learning-Project


In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. We train 4 models: **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosted Trees**, **Support Vector Machine** using k-folds cross validation on the training set. We then predict using a validation set randomly selected from the training csv data to obtain the **accuracy** and **out of sample error rate**. Based on those numbers, we decide on the best model, and use it to predict 20 cases using the test csv set.
